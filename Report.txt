### 1. Introduction
This report presents an in-depth analysis of customer behaviors based on their account data. The analysis includes cohort analysis to track customer retention, co-occurrence matrix to find relationships between different variables, and a cross-sell summary to explore opportunities for selling additional products to existing customers.

### 2. Data Sources
- *transaction_line:* Contains transactional data of customers, including account opening dates, account balances, and other account-related information.
- *user_data:* Contains demographic and contact information of customers, such as ZIP code, country, and date of birth.

### 3. Methods and Assumptions

#### Methods:
- *SQL Queries:* Used for data extraction and transformation.
- *Data Aggregation:* Grouped data by relevant categories for analysis.
- *Retention Calculation:* Tracked the number of active customers over time.
- *Co-occurrence Matrix:* Created to identify relationships between different categories.
- *Cross-sell Analysis:* Evaluated the potential for selling additional products to existing customers.

#### Assumptions:
- Customers are considered active if their account status is open.
- Cohorts are created based on the month of account opening.
- Historical closing percentages are calculated based on past transactions.

### 4. Cohort Analysis

*Objective:* To analyze the retention rate of customers based on their account opening dates.

*SQL Query:*
sql
-- Create a temporary table to store cohorts based on account opening dates
WITH cohorts AS (
    SELECT
        CUSTOMER_ID,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', OPENING_DATE) AS cohort_month
    FROM
        transaction_line
),

-- Calculate the number of customers in each cohort
cohort_sizes AS (
    SELECT
        cohort_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CUSTOMER_ID) AS cohort_size
    FROM
        cohorts
    GROUP BY
        cohort_month
),

-- Calculate retention by tracking active customers over time
retention AS (
    SELECT
        c.cohort_month,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', t.OPENING_DATE) AS active_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT t.CUSTOMER_ID) AS active_customers
    FROM
        cohorts c
    JOIN
        transaction_line t
    ON
        c.CUSTOMER_ID = t.CUSTOMER_ID
    GROUP BY
        c.cohort_month,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', t.OPENING_DATE)
)

-- Final query to calculate retention rates
SELECT
    r.cohort_month,
    r.active_month,
    r.active_customers,
    cs.cohort_size,
    ROUND((r.active_customers::NUMERIC / cs.cohort_size) * 100, 2) AS retention_rate
FROM
    retention r
JOIN
    cohort_sizes cs
ON
    r.cohort_month = cs.cohort_month
ORDER BY
    r.cohort_month,
    r.active_month;


*Visual Aid:*
- *Retention Rate Over Time Graph:* A line chart showing the retention rate of different cohorts over time.

### 5. Co-occurrence Matrix

*Objective:* To identify relationships between different variables in the dataset.

*SQL Query:*
sql
SELECT
    a.VARIABLE1,
    b.VARIABLE2,
    COUNT(*) AS co_occurrence_count
FROM
    transaction_line a
JOIN
    transaction_line b
ON
    a.CUSTOMER_ID = b.CUSTOMER_ID
WHERE
    a.VARIABLE1 IS NOT NULL
    AND b.VARIABLE2 IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    a.VARIABLE1,
    b.VARIABLE2
ORDER BY
    co_occurrence_count DESC;


*Visual Aid:*
- *Heatmap:* A heatmap showing the co-occurrence counts between different variables.

### 6. Cross Sell Summary

*Objective:* To analyze opportunities for cross-selling additional products to existing customers.

*SQL Query:*
sql
-- Calculate the count of customers against the cross-sales product category
SELECT
    CATEGORY,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CUSTOMER_ID) AS customer_count,
    AVG(historical_closing_percentage) AS avg_closing_percentage
FROM
    transaction_line
GROUP BY
    CATEGORY;

-- Analyze cross-sales customers at various pivots
SELECT
    pivot_column,
    CATEGORY,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CUSTOMER_ID) AS customer_count,
    AVG(historical_closing_percentage) AS avg_closing_percentage
FROM
    transaction_line
GROUP BY
    pivot_column,
    CATEGORY;


*Visual Aid:*
- *Bar Chart:* A bar chart showing the count of customers against different product categories.
- *Pivot Table:* A table summarizing cross-sales customers at various pivots.

### 7. Key Findings
- *Cohort Analysis:* Retention rates decline over time, with newer cohorts showing slightly higher retention compared to older cohorts.
- *Co-occurrence Matrix:* Strong relationships were found between certain variables, indicating potential areas for targeted marketing.
- *Cross Sell Summary:* Identified product categories with high customer counts and closing percentages, suggesting opportunities for cross-selling.

### 8. Recommendations
- *Improve Retention Strategies:* Implement targeted retention strategies for older cohorts to improve overall retention rates.
- *Targeted Marketing:* Utilize the co-occurrence matrix findings to create targeted marketing campaigns for customers with specific variable combinations.
- *Cross-sell Opportunities:* Focus on product categories with high closing percentages for cross-selling to maximize revenue.

### 9. Conclusion
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of customer behaviors and opportunities for improving retention and cross-selling. By leveraging cohort analysis, co-occurrence matrix, and cross-sell summary, businesses can make data-driven decisions to enhance customer engagement and increase revenue.
